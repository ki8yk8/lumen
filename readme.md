## Gameplay

You are the player who can only move forward but worry not you rotate continuously helping you to move at specific postion.

At each level, you have a laser light and your target is to align the mirrors such that the laser hits the target.

### How to Play?

1. Move towards each mirror, once you collid with the mirror, you can press `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down` key to rotate the mirror.
2. Once the mirror hits the target, wait for some photons to hit the target and let it be completely red.
3. Once red, collide with the target to proceed to the next level.

## Game Controls

- `Space` to move,
- `ArrowUp` and `Arrow Down` to rotate the mirrors,

## About the Game Engine

This game engine was started during Axiom YSWS, during the siege I have added more feature to the engine, including;

- Support for images as sprites,
- Support for scene managment,
- Support for builtin timer component,
- Better controls for texts.

This repository starts with the base repository of axiom and builts the game on top of it. The repository and commit history are completely new, this is just like using NPM library. The hackatime project is completely different from the one used in Axiom.
